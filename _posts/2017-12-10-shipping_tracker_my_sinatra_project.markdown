It’s the time of year where there are a seemingly endless number of packages shooting around the country as people take advantage of holiday sales and shop for gifts. While I personally don’t receive packages at an unmanageable rate (when I’ve ordered something I’m basically constantly checking the tracking info), I can see how it would be easy to lose track (yea) of the status of all your shipments. Hence, Shipping Tracker.

The biggest takeaway I have from this project is to use the tools that are available. For example, throughout the Sinatra module I saw Avi using database apps to look at what was in the database in the video lectures or reviews. I took note of it, but hadn’t gotten around to downloading one because I didn’t really need it in the labs and I wanted to get used to manipulating the database from a console.

But when it comes to testing forms over and over, being able to see what’s being put into the table was invaluable. When an object gets put in, but without any attributes so it breaks your index…I can just imagine spending a bunch of time trying to figure out what happened if I wasn’t able to just look at the table and then delete the offending entry.

I had the same kind of experience when trying to dress up my app. After I finished a lot of the main functions I wanted to experiment with the HTML/CSS. I wasn’t really sure where to start, but toward the beginning of the program we were introduced to Twitter Bootstrap. So I went back to that and was making changes to the style of the site in no time.

Overall, this project was really satisfying to me for a few reasons. For one, after completing all the labs I felt ready to go out and make something. For another it was something you could interact with outside of the command line, and while the code might not be that far off, it’s just a lot more gratifying to see your application in browser. That makes me even more excited to move on to Rails.
