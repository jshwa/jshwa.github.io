Learning programming has always felt like a no-brainer to me. I can’t really think of a scenario where I would tell someone not to learn to code, at least a little bit. It’s one of those skills that it really can’t hurt to have, and there are dozens of lists of reasons why plastered all over the internet. Things like improving logical thinking and problem solving, if you haven’t seen them, [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/education/edlife/teaching-students-computer-code.html), [here](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/are-programmer-brains-different-2068a52648a7), and [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/six-reasons-non-computer-nerd-might-want-learn-code/328102/) are a few, or just use the googles.

For the last 5 years I’ve been a debate coach, but I was fortunate enough to have the means and support to leave my last job and pursue a new career. I’ve been a debater for almost half my life and the things that made me love debate are a lot of the same things that make me excited to be in programming: having to be creative to find the next big argument, trying to see 3 or 4 steps ahead, and of course the pride we take in being the most logical (often incorrectly). Becoming a software developer seems more like the next step than a radical departure from what I was doing before. 

The skills necessary to debate are extremely useful and valuable, but the opportunities to actually use them on debate are limited if you're not in school or teaching at one. For coding, I feel like you get to practice the skills, and use them on an activity that can take you anywhere. I’m a little nervous about the prospect of learning a skill from scratch and trying to get hired to do it, but this is definitely something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, and I’m super excited to see where it takes me. And hey, at least I don’t have to wait until retirement to do it like some of [these people.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/your-money/some-people-learn-to-code-in-their-60s-70s-or-80s.html)

By the way, Avi's quoted in that last article.
